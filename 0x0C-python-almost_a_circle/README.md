|FILES| DESCRIPTIONS|
|---|---|
|tests/|  All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated. |
|models/base.py, models/__init__.py|  Write the first class ```Base```:|
|models/rectangle.py|  Write the class ```Rectangle``` that inherits from ```Base```:|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (```id``` excluded):|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by adding the public method ```def area(self):``` that returns the area value of the ```Rectangle``` instance.|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by adding the public method ```def display(self):``` that prints in stdout the ```Rectangle``` instance with the character ```#``` - you donâ€™t need to handle ```x``` and ```y``` here.|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by overriding the ```__str__``` method so that it returns ```[Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/y> - <width>/<height>```|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by improving the public method ```def display(self):``` to print in stdout the ```Rectangle``` instance with the character ```#``` by taking care of ```x``` and ```y```|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by adding the public method ```def update(self, *args):``` that assigns an argument to each attribute:|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by updating the public method ```def update(self, *args):``` by changing the prototype to ```update(self, *args, **kwargs)``` that assigns a key/value argument to attributes:|
|models/square.py|  Write the class ```Square``` that inherits from ```Rectangle```:|
|models/square.py|  Update the class ```Square``` by adding the public getter and setter ```size```|
|models/square.py|  Update the class ```Square``` by adding the public method ```def update(self, *args, **kwargs)``` that assigns attributes:|
|models/rectangle.py|  Update the class ```Rectangle``` by adding the public method ```def to_dictionary(self):``` that returns the dictionary representation of a ```Rectangle```:|
|models/square.py|  Update the class ```Square``` by adding the public method ```def to_dictionary(self):``` that returns the dictionary representation of a ```Square```:|
|models/base.py|  JSON is one of the standard formats for sharing data representation.|
|models/base.py|  Update the class ```Base``` by adding the class method ```def save_to_file(cls, list_objs):``` that writes the JSON string representation of ```list_objs``` to a file:|
|models/base.py|  Update the class ```Base``` by adding the static method ```def from_json_string(json_string):``` that returns the list of the JSON string representation ```json_string```:|
|models/base.py|  Update the class ```Base``` by adding the class method ```def create(cls, **dictionary):``` that returns an instance with all attributes already set:|
|models/base.py|  Update the class ```Base``` by adding the class method ```def load_from_file(cls):``` that returns a list of instances:|
